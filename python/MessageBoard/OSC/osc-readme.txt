Changes:

- in order to make it simpler to use simpleOSC the callBackManager and ouSockets are now
global variables in the oscAPI module so that the user does not have to deal with them. This
makes the API cleaner and more compact. 

0.1.3
- switched licence to LGPL.

0.1.2
- some tiding up

0.1.1
- removed oscController.py to make it more general
- osc.py and oscAPI.py are now a package to make it more compact
- included latest version of OSC.py 


Description:
SimpleOSC is a simple API for the Open Sound Control for Python 
(by Daniel Holth, Clinton McChesney 
--> pyKit.tar.gz file at http://wiretap.stetson.edu
Documentation at http://wiretap.stetson.edu/docs/pyKit/)

The main aim of this implementation is to provide with a simple way to
deal with the OSC implementation that makes life easier to those who
don't have understanding of sockets. This would not be on your screen
without the help of Daniel Holth and the  support of Buchsenhausen, Innsbruck, Austria..
